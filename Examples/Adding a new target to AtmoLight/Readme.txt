We have provided an example structure of AtmoLight.
This structure will show you which files need changing in order for you to add a new target to AtmoLight.
The files themselves show a rudimentary structure of the code within them. And show what exactly needs to be added.
Please make the the necessary changes according to the examples.

Within this example structure we call our new target "Example".

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us in the MediaPortal forums (Lightning303, Rick164).
